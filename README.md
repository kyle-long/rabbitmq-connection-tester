rabbitmq-connection-tester
==========================
A tool for testing a rabbitmq connection.

You would only need this tool if you are using an older version of `rabbitmqctl` which does not already contain the `authenticate_user` command or perhaps if you'd like to test the connection from another machine that doesn't have rabbitmq installed.
